![My adorable dog!](img_grad.jpg)

I am a second year student in the research master Methodology and Statistics for the Behavioural, Biomedical and Social Sciences. I did my bachelor's in sociology, but soon found out that I preferred every course that had to do with numbers, the more, the better. I began taking every available statistics course as elective and absolutely fell in love with all that is statistics. Now that my master is almost finished, I look back on two years of enthousiastic learning and hard work, and I would not want it any different.

My interests lie in psychometrics and Bayesian statistics. 
        
In my free time I love to visit friends and family, go for a walk while listening to music or an audiobook, or knit. I am a member of the                   christian student organisation <a href="https://ichthusutrecht.nl/">Ichthus</a> where I am part of a Bible study group and a committee that                 writes a report advising on long-term policy measures. Whenever I am at my parents', I will make sure to spend a lot of time with my dog.
