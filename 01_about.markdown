    <p>I am a second year student of the research master <a href="https://www.uu.nl/masters/en/methodology-and-statistics-behavioural-biomedical-and-social-sciences">Methodology and Statistics for the Behavioural, Biomedical and Social Sciences</a> at Utrecht University. I did my bachelor's in sociology, but soon found out that I preferred every course that had to do with numbers: the more, the better. I began taking every available statistics course as an elective and absolutely fell in love with everything that entails statistics. Now that I am almost finished with my master's, I look back on two years of enthousiastic learning and hard work, and I would not want it any other way.</p>
    <p>Within statistics, my interests lie in psychometrics and Bayesian statistics. I like to build functions and spend time improving my coding skills in R. I am also passionate about making statistics understandable and showing people that there is no need to fear it.</p>
    <p>In my free time I love to visit friends and family, go for a walk while listening to music or an audiobook, or knit. I am a member of the christian student organisation <a href="https://ichthusutrecht.nl/">Ichthus</a> where I am part of a Bible study group and a committee that writes a report advising on long-term policy measures. Whenever I am at my parents', I will make sure to spend a lot of time with my dog.</p>
